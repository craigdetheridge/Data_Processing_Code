# Data_Processing_Code
Code I use/share for processing my research data.

@author: cndetheridge

Hello. In the unlikely event that you stumbled upon this code, it will likely be useless to you in its' current form. These code support my data processing/extraction of custom files, and are very context-dependent for use.

However, feel free to observe my naming conventions, function choice, organizational structure, and programming etiquette for learning purposes.

Any code found within this repository may be discussed, used, and shared; as long as appropriate credit is given to the author.

Cheers!
